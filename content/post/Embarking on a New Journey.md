title: Embarking on a New Journey
---

**August 7, 2023** – Today, I set off for the United States, bidding farewell to my parents, friends, and everything familiar to embark on a new journey.

This day is filled with a mix of emotions – a bittersweet moment of saying goodbye while feeling excited for what lies ahead. As I looked back at the faces of my loved ones, I felt both the warmth of their support and the weight of leaving them behind. Heading to the U.S. is not just a trip; it’s a step toward growth, exploration, and new experiences.

As I boarded the plane, I realized that the path forward is full of unknowns. There will likely be challenges, but I believe each experience will be an essential part of my growth. With determination and dreams, I am ready to take this step.

Thank you to my family and friends for all the encouragement and support – it means the world to me. A new chapter begins, and I look forward to sharing the journey with you all!

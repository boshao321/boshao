## Welcome to Bo's Homepage!<br>

My name is Bo Shao, though most people simply call me Bo. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Logistics Engineering from [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/) and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/industrial-systems-engineering/) at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).

I love outdoor hiking because being close to nature brings me a sense of inner peace. I also enjoy cooking, and there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of tasting my own culinary creations. One of my favorite quotes is: *“Put your head down and fight, fight, fight! Never, ever, ever give up! Things will work out just fine.”*

You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/).

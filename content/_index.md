    <p>My name is Bo Shao, though most people simply call me Bo. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Logistics Engineering from <a href="https://www.fzu.edu.cn/">Fuzhou University</a> and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in <a href="https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/industrial-systems-engineering/">Industrial & Systems Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>.</p>

<p>I love outdoor hiking because being close to nature brings me a sense of inner peace. I also enjoy cooking, and there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of tasting my own culinary creations. One of my favorite quotes is: <em>“Put your head down and fight, fight, fight! Never, ever, ever give up! Things will work out just fine.”</em></p>

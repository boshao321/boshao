**Black Pepper Beef Stir-Fry (黑椒牛柳)** is a classic Chinese stir-fry dish known for its bold black pepper flavor and tender beef. It’s quick to make, making it a perfect weeknight meal. Here’s how to prepare it at home.

### Ingredients

1. **Main Ingredients**:
   - 300g beef sirloin or tenderloin, cut into thin strips
   - 1 bell pepper (red or green), sliced
   - 1 small onion, sliced
   - 1/2 carrot, julienned (optional)
2. **Marinade**:
   - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
   - 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
   - 1 teaspoon cornstarch
   - 1/2 teaspoon sugar
   - 1 tablespoon cooking wine
   - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper (freshly ground for best flavor)
3. **Stir-Fry Sauce**:
   - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
   - 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
   - 1/2 teaspoon sugar
   - 1 teaspoon black pepper (adjust to taste)
4. **Aromatics**:
   - 2 cloves garlic, minced
   - 1 small piece ginger, minced

### Instructions

1. **Marinate the Beef**:
   - In a bowl, combine the beef strips with the marinade ingredients: soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornstarch, sugar, cooking wine, and black pepper.
   - Mix well and let it marinate for 15-20 minutes to enhance the flavor and tenderize the beef.

2. **Prepare the Stir-Fry Sauce**:
   - In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and black pepper. Set aside.

3. **Sear the Beef**:
   - Heat a bit of oil in a large pan or wok over high heat.
   - Add the marinated beef and stir-fry quickly until the beef is just cooked and slightly charred. Remove from the pan and set aside.

4. **Cook the Vegetables**:
   - In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed, then add minced garlic and ginger. Sauté until fragrant.
   - Add the sliced onion, bell pepper, and carrot, stir-frying for a couple of minutes until they are slightly tender but still crisp.

5. **Combine and Season**:
   - Return the beef to the pan and pour in the stir-fry sauce.
   - Stir everything together, ensuring the beef and vegetables are well-coated in the sauce. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce is slightly reduced and coats the ingredients.

6. **Serve**:
   - Transfer to a plate and serve hot. This dish pairs perfectly with steamed rice.

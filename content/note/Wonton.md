**Wontons (馄饨)** are a beloved Chinese dumpling, typically filled with seasoned pork or shrimp, wrapped in thin dough, and served in a light broth or with sauce. Here’s a simple recipe to make these comforting dumplings at home.

### Ingredients

1. **Wonton Filling**:
   - 250g ground pork (or ground chicken/shrimp)
   - 1 green onion, finely chopped
   - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
   - 1/2 tablespoon oyster sauce
   - 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
   - 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
   - 1 teaspoon grated ginger
   - 1 teaspoon cornstarch
   - Salt to taste

2. **Wonton Wrappers**:
   - 30-40 wonton wrappers (available at Asian grocery stores)

3. **Broth (optional)**:
   - 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
   - A few slices of ginger
   - A handful of chopped green onions
   - Salt and white pepper to taste

4. **Garnishes**:
   - Chopped green onions
   - A few drops of sesame oil
   - Soy sauce or chili oil (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Filling**:
   - In a mixing bowl, combine ground pork, green onion, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, grated ginger, and cornstarch.
   - Mix everything together thoroughly until well-combined. The cornstarch helps bind the filling.

2. **Wrap the Wontons**:
   - Place a wonton wrapper on a flat surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of filling onto the center of the wrapper.
   - Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a bit of water, then fold it over to form a triangle or rectangle. Press the edges firmly to seal.
   - Optionally, bring the two corners of the wrapper together and pinch to create a traditional wonton shape.

3. **Cook the Wontons**:
   - Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil.
   - Add the wontons to the pot in batches, being careful not to overcrowd.
   - Boil for 4-5 minutes, or until the wontons float to the surface and the filling is fully cooked.

4. **Prepare the Broth (optional)**:
   - In a separate pot, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a simmer.
   - Add ginger slices and green onions, and season with salt and white pepper to taste.
   - Let the broth simmer for a few minutes to infuse the flavors, then remove the ginger slices.

5. **Serve**:
   - Transfer cooked wontons to serving bowls. Pour hot broth over the wontons if desired.
   - Garnish with chopped green onions, a few drops of sesame oil, and optional soy sauce or chili oil for extra flavor.

### Enjoy!

Wontons are versatile and can be enjoyed in soup or with a dipping sauce. This warm, savory dish is perfect for any season and can be customized with your favorite fillings!

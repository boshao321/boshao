      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10, 2024&lt;/strong&gt; – Today, I had the incredible experience of presenting at the OMEA/MBAA 2024 conference in Chicago. This was my first time speaking at an international conference, and I was really nervous. Despite the nerves, I learned a lot and gained valuable insights from this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presenting in front of an international audience was challenging but rewarding. I realize there’s still much room for improvement, and I need to keep pushing myself to grow and gain confidence in these settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7, 2023&lt;/strong&gt; – Today, I set off for the United States, bidding farewell to my parents, friends, and everything familiar to embark on a new journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This day is filled with a mix of emotions – a bittersweet moment of saying goodbye while feeling excited for what lies ahead. As I looked back at the faces of my loved ones, I felt both the warmth of their support and the weight of leaving them behind. Heading to the U.S. is not just a trip; it’s a step toward growth, exploration, and new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

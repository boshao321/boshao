      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10, 2024&lt;/strong&gt; – Today, I had the incredible experience of presenting at the OMEA/MBAA 2024 conference in Chicago. This was my first time speaking at an international conference, and I was really nervous. Despite the nerves, I learned a lot and gained valuable insights from this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presenting in front of an international audience was challenging but rewarding. I realize there’s still much room for improvement, and I need to keep pushing myself to grow and gain confidence in these settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
